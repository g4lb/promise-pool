# Promise Pool

A Promise Pool is a utility that manages a pool of promises in TypeScript, allowing for controlled concurrency when executing asynchronous tasks. This README provides an overview of the Promise Pool implementation using a queue data structure and provides usage instructions.

## Installation

To use the Promise Pool with a queue data structure in your TypeScript project, you can install it via npm or yarn:

```shell
npm install 
```

## Example

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of Promise Pool with a queue data structure, the example limiting the number of concurrent Promises being executed at a given time (currently its 100)

```shell
npm start
```
